# Yohoo Default Start Page Design

**Date:** 2026-01-17
**Author:** Claude (with Eivind Throndsen)
**Purpose:** Create an engaging, useful out-of-the-box experience for new users

---

## Design Philosophy

Inspired by classic Norwegian portals like Startsiden (founded 1996), this design balances:

1. **Immediate utility** - Links that work for anyone from day one
2. **Local relevance** - Norwegian services, news, and culture
3. **International perspective** - Quality global sources
4. **Personalization space** - Clearly labeled sections for users to customize
5. **Discovery** - A few unexpected/delightful links to explore

The goal is a start page that feels curated and thoughtful, not overwhelming—a digital home base.

## User-Customizable Sections (Pre-created but Empty)

These sections appear with placeholder text encouraging the user to add their own links:

### 🏢 My Work
*"Add your company intranet, project boards, and work tools here"*

| Placeholder | Note |
|-------------|------|
| Vibe (Intranet) | https://vibe.vend.com/home/ |
| Jira / Linear / Asana | Your project tracker |
| Confluence / Wiki | Internal docs |
| Slack / Teams | Communication |
| Email | mail.google.com |

### 💼 My Projects
*"Your current side projects, repos, and builds"*

### 📖 Reading List
*"Articles and sites you want to revisit"*

### 🏠 Personal
*"Banking, utilities, subscriptions - your private links"*

### ⭐ Favorites
*"Your most-used links - drag anything here"*

---

## Visual Design Notes

### Color Theme
Keep the existing dark mauve theme but consider:
- Section headers with subtle color coding
- Norwegian flag colors (red/blue) as accents for Norway-specific sections
- Muted tones for work sections (grays/blues)
- Warmer tones for entertainment/lifestyle (purples/magentas)

### Layout Principles
1. **Three-column layout** keep existing layout 
2. **Collapsible sections** - let users hide what they don't need
3. **Section reordering** - drag entire sections, not just links
4. **Quick search** - existing `/` shortcut filters all sections

### Icons
Consider using simple emoji or a consistent icon set (Lucide, Heroicons) for section headers to aid visual scanning.

---

## Implementation Notes

### Data Structure
The default links should be stored in `data/default_links.json` with this structure:

```json
{
  "sections": [
    {
      "id": "norway-essentials",
      "name": "Norway Essentials",
      "emoji": "🇳🇴",
      "category": "essentials",
      "editable": true,
      "links": [
        {
          "title": "Yr (Weather)",
          "url": "https://www.yr.no/en",
          "description": "Norway's trusted weather service"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "userSections": [
    {
      "id": "my-work",
      "name": "My Work",
      "emoji": "🏢",
      "placeholder": "Add your company intranet, project boards, and work tools here",
      "links": []
    }
  ]
}
```

### localStorage Behavior
- First-time users get full default layout
- Any user modifications override defaults
- "Reset to defaults" option in settings
- User sections persist even after reset

### Link Metadata
Consider adding optional fields:
- `favicon`: Auto-fetched or manual override
- `lastVisited`: Track usage for smart sorting
- `tags`: For enhanced search


---

## Next Steps

1. **Review and refine** - Eivind to adjust links based on personal preferences
2. **Create JSON data file** - Convert tables to `data/default_links.json`
3. **Update generate_html.py** - Load defaults, merge with user customizations
4. **Add settings option** - "Reset to defaults" button
5. **Test with fresh browser** - Verify first-run experience

*"A good start page is like a good home office - everything you need within reach, nothing in the way."*
