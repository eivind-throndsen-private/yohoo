I want a personal, yahoo-like start page with the links I use on a daily basis aor frequently are all available, sorted thematically. I also want to be able to update this page from time to time, based on my most used links. create a useful main category scafffold, grouping bookmarks less than one year old from the bookmarks file. also design a fscript that can read my browsing history from chrome and surface the most used pages / links as candidates for inclusion.
